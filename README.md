# Depth Pro - AI Depth Map Generator

> **Note:** This is a personal project to try out Apple's ml-depth-pro model. After getting it working locally with easy-to-use scripts, I decided to publish it so anyone else interested can try it too. The core model and logic are from the original Apple repository. The original license is retained.

Transform any 2D image into a detailed 3D depth map using Apple's open-source **Depth Pro** model.

---

## Quick Start (Local)

1.  **Clone the repository** and enter the directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro.git depth-pro-demo
    cd depth-pro-demo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies** (Python â‰¥ 3.10 is recommended):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: For Apple Silicon, you will need a PyTorch version that supports MPS.*

3.  **Download Model Weights** (approx. 1.8 GB):

    The scripts will automatically download the `depth_pro.pt` file on the first run. You can also download it manually:

    ```bash
    curl -L -o depth_pro.pt https://huggingface.co/apple/depth-pro/resolve/main/depth_pro.pt
    ```

4.  **Run the Demo**:

    For Mac: `python run_local_mac.py`
    
    For Windows or Linux: `python run_local_windows_linux.py`

    The application will start at http://127.0.0.1:7860 and open in your browser automatically.

## Features

- **GPU Accelerated**: Optimized for Apple Silicon (MPS) and NVIDIA (CUDA), with a CPU fallback.
- **Metric Depth**: Predicts true, real-world depth and estimates focal length automatically.
- **Private**: All processing happens 100% locally on your machine. No data is sent to the cloud.
- **Open-Source**: Based on Apple's powerful research, free to use without API keys or restrictions.

## Research

This work is based on the paper "Depth Pro: Sharp Monocular Metric Depth in Less Than a Second" (2024) by A. Bochkovskii, A. Delaunoy, H. Germain, M. Santos, Y. Zhou, S. Richter, and V. Koltun.
